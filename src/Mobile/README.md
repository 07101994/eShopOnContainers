**Note**: The Visual Studio Android Emulator cannot run well inside a virtual machine or over Remote Desktop or VNC since it relies on virtualization and OpenGL. 

To deploy and debug the application on a physical device, refer to these [link](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/debug-on-device/).
